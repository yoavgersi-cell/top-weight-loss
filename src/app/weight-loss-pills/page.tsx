  { question: "Do weight loss pills actually work?", answer: "Prescription weight loss pills can work, but results vary a lot by medication. FDA-approved options like Qsymia and Contrave produce roughly 5–10% average weight loss, while newer high-dose oral semaglutide has reached ~15% in trials. Over-the-counter 'fat burner' or 'natural' pills are largely unproven and are not a substitute for prescription treatment." },
  { question: "Is there a weight loss pill as effective as Ozempic or Wegovy?", answer: "Getting close. Oral semaglutide at a 25mg dose (an oral version of Wegovy) has shown around 15% weight loss in trials — comparable to the semaglutide injection — and is advancing through FDA review. Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 from Eli Lilly, is also in late-stage trials. For now, weekly injections still lead on average results." },
  { question: "What is the strongest prescription weight loss pill?", answer: "Among currently FDA-approved oral options, Qsymia (phentermine/topiramate) tends to produce the most weight loss — roughly 8–10% on average. High-dose oral semaglutide, where available, is more effective still." },
  { question: "Can you get weight loss pills online?", answer: "Yes. Licensed telehealth providers can evaluate you online and, when appropriate, prescribe oral weight loss medications. A clinician determines whether an oral or injectable option fits your health profile and goals." },
  { question: "Are weight loss pills or injections better?", answer: "It depends on your priorities. Injections currently produce greater average weight loss, but pills avoid needles, can be simpler to start, and newer oral GLP-1s are closing the gap. The right choice comes down to your goals, tolerance, and what a clinician recommends." },
  { question: "GLP-1 pills vs injections — which works better?", answer: "Injectable GLP-1s (semaglutide, tirzepatide) still lead on average weight loss — roughly 15–20%+ in trials — while most GLP-1 pills land lower. The exception is high-dose oral semaglutide, which has reached ~15% in trials and is closing the gap. Pills win on convenience: no needles and a simple daily tablet. If maximum results matter most, injections lead today; if avoiding needles matters more, a GLP-1 pill can be a strong fit." },
