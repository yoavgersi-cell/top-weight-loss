  { question: "What is retatrutide?", answer: "Retatrutide (sometimes called “reta” or a “triple agonist”) is an investigational once-weekly injection from Eli Lilly. Unlike semaglutide (a GLP-1) or tirzepatide (a dual GLP-1/GIP), retatrutide targets three receptors at once — GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon — which is why it has produced the largest weight loss of any drug in trials so far." },
  { question: "How much weight loss does retatrutide cause?", answer: "In a Phase 2 trial, participants on the highest dose lost about 24% of their body weight over 48 weeks — more than tirzepatide (~20%) or semaglutide (~15%) in their trials. These are early results; larger Phase 3 trials are underway to confirm them." },
  { question: "Is retatrutide FDA approved?", answer: "No. As of 2026, retatrutide is investigational and has not been approved by the FDA for weight loss or any other use. It is being studied in late-stage (Phase 3) clinical trials." },
  { question: "When will retatrutide be available?", answer: "It depends on the outcome of its Phase 3 program and FDA review. Industry expectations point to a potential approval in the 2026–2027 window, but timelines can shift. Until it's approved, it cannot be legitimately prescribed for weight loss." },
  { question: "Retatrutide vs tirzepatide — which is more effective?", answer: "In their respective trials, retatrutide produced more weight loss (~24%) than tirzepatide (~20%+). But tirzepatide is FDA-approved and available today, while retatrutide is still investigational. For most people the practical comparison is between the approved options — with retatrutide as a promising future addition." },
  { question: "Can you buy retatrutide now?", answer: "No. Because it isn't FDA-approved, retatrutide is not legitimately available to purchase or be prescribed for weight loss. Be cautious of any site claiming to sell “retatrutide” — sourcing an unapproved drug carries real safety and legal risks. Stick to approved medications prescribed by a licensed clinician." },

            Retatrutide is an investigational once-weekly injection from Eli Lilly. What makes it
            different is that it&rsquo;s a <strong className="text-[#191919]">triple agonist</strong>:
            it activates three receptors at once — GLP-1 and GIP (like tirzepatide) plus a third,
            glucagon. That extra target is thought to boost metabolism and fat burning on top of the
            appetite effects, which is why it has produced the largest weight loss seen in trials so far.
