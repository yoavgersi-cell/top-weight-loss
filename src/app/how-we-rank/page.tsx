          <p className="text-[16px] leading-[1.75] text-gray-600">
            Each provider earns an overall score on a 10-point scale, translated into a plain-English
            label — from <strong className="text-[#191919]">Exceptional</strong> at the top through{" "}
            <strong className="text-[#191919]">Excellent</strong> and{" "}
            <strong className="text-[#191919]">Very Good</strong>. A score reflects the weighted result
            across the six factors above. Strong transparent pricing, credible medical oversight, and
            consistently positive recent customer feedback move a score up; hidden fees, thin medical
            support, or recurring complaints move it down.

                In a head-to-head comparison we score the two providers category by category —
                pricing, medical support, medication options, speed, and customer experience. The
                provider that wins the majority of categories takes the matchup, and the advantage
                meter reflects how decisive that edge is. We always name the runner-up&rsquo;s genuine
                strengths, because the &ldquo;better&rdquo; provider still depends on what you value most.
