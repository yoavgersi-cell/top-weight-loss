    question: "What is the best alternative to Ozempic?",
    answer:
      "For most people, the most effective alternative to Ozempic isn't a different drug at all — it's the same active ingredient (semaglutide) prescribed as an affordable compounded version through a licensed telehealth provider. Ozempic and Wegovy are both semaglutide; the brand versions are expensive and often hard to get, while compounded semaglutide delivers the same molecule, typically for a fraction of the list price. If you want a stronger option, tirzepatide (the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound) produced even greater average weight loss in trials and is also available as a compounded telehealth option.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is compounded semaglutide the same as Ozempic?",
    answer:
      "They share the same active ingredient — semaglutide. Ozempic is Novo Nordisk's brand-name, FDA-approved product; compounded semaglutide is made by a licensed compounding pharmacy and prescribed by a provider after a medical review. The medicine works the same way, but compounded products are not FDA-approved brand drugs and can vary by pharmacy, so it matters to use a provider that works with reputable, state-licensed compounding pharmacies.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's a cheaper alternative to Mounjaro?",
    answer:
      "Mounjaro's active ingredient is tirzepatide. The cheaper route most people use is compounded tirzepatide prescribed online through a telehealth provider — the same dual GLP-1/GIP molecule, usually well below brand list price. Brand Mounjaro and Zepbound can run over $1,000/month without insurance; compounded tirzepatide from telehealth providers is often advertised from around $150–$300/month depending on the provider and dose.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there alternatives to Ozempic without insurance?",
    answer:
      "Yes — this is exactly where telehealth GLP-1 providers fit. They prescribe compounded semaglutide or tirzepatide on a cash-pay basis, so you don't need insurance coverage for a brand drug. Pricing is typically a flat monthly amount that includes the medication, the provider consultation, and ongoing support.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there an over-the-counter (OTC) Ozempic?",
    answer:
      "No. There is no legitimate over-the-counter version of Ozempic or any GLP-1 medication — they are prescription-only. Any product marketed as 'OTC Ozempic,' 'Ozempic in a bottle,' or a supplement claiming the same effects is not the real medication. The legitimate lower-cost path is a prescription for compounded semaglutide or tirzepatide through a licensed provider.",
  },
  {
    question: "Semaglutide vs tirzepatide — which alternative is more effective?",
    answer:
      "In their respective clinical trials, tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound) produced greater average weight loss (roughly 20%+) than semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy, roughly 15%). Both are highly effective and both are available as compounded telehealth options. Tirzepatide tends to cost a little more. The right choice depends on your medical history and your provider's guidance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are compounded GLP-1 alternatives safe and legal?",
    answer:
      "Compounded medications are prescribed by licensed clinicians and made by state-licensed compounding pharmacies that follow federal compounding standards. They are legal when prescribed appropriately, but they are not FDA-approved brand products, and quality depends on the pharmacy. Choose a provider that is transparent about its pharmacies, requires a real medical intake, and offers ongoing clinical support — which is what we weigh in our provider rankings.",

            Brand-name Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound can run{" "}
            <strong className="text-[#191919]">over $1,000 a month at list price</strong> without
            insurance, and coverage for weight loss is inconsistent. Licensed telehealth providers work
            with compounding pharmacies to prescribe the same active ingredients — semaglutide or
            tirzepatide — on a flat, cash-pay basis. In practice that&rsquo;s often{" "}
            <strong className="text-[#191919]">around $99–$300 a month</strong> depending on the
            medication, dose, and provider, with the consultation and ongoing support included.

          <p>
            The trade-off: compounded products aren&rsquo;t FDA-approved brand drugs, and quality
            depends on the pharmacy behind them. That&rsquo;s why the provider you choose matters more
            than the brand name on the box — you want transparent pharmacies, a real medical intake, and
            genuine clinical follow-up.
